# Robot Saga

Completed prototype! Great job everyone!

Robot Saga is a proof-of-concept Jython game engine, developed for JES from scratch. JES was never meant 
to run anything like this; we pushed it to the limit. There are certainly further optimizations to be made,
but the team feels we largely rose to the occation of getting an interactive game running out of JES.  Any future implementations
would be developed more seriously on a better suited platform.
