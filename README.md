# Robot Saga

Completed prototype! Great job everyone!

Robot Saga is a proof-of-concept Jython game engine tech-demo, developed for JES from scratch. JES was never meant 
to run anything like this; we pushed it to the limit. There are certainly further optimizations to be made,
but the team feels we largely rose to the occation of getting an interactive game running out of JES.  Any future implementations
would be developed more seriously on a better suited platform.

We were given 4 weeks to come up with a unique multimedia sample using JES.  Not content with simple image filters and soundbytes,
team SAGA went the extra mile. There are some obvious compromises made due to the time and platform constraint, but the end product features:
- An explorable town
- Currency
- Loot
- Levels
- Multiple weapons
- Three "field" areas with dynamic enemy spawns
- Level-scaled enemies
- Dynamic robo-gore and lighting
- Save/load features
- Explorable dungeon complete with a boss
